Situation:\na. General. A MRB(-) is defending the Delta and Cleghorn corridors. The MRB is thought to\nhave one MRC in each corridor. Engineering equipment has been detected and obstacles can\nbe expected.\nb. Enemy.\n(1) Composition, Disposition and Strength: MRC(+) defending Delta Corridor with 3-4\nMRPs, I AT Plt, and 1 ADA section\n-MRP (-) (NT900997) 3 BTR-T (T55 chassis APC wl30mm AC and AT-5)\n-MRP(-) (SUS~) (NT871990) 3 BTR-T\n-MRP (NU87403 1) 3 BMP-2,18 pax, 3 FN MAG GPMG, 3 RPK, 3 RPG7, 1 SA-7;\ndeployed 2 up, 1 back in trenches whunkers\n-AT Plt (NU863037) 3 BRDMs wIAT-5\n-MRP (NU858076) 3 BMP-2, 18 pax, 3 RPK, 3 RPG7, 1 SA-7; deployed 2 up, 1 back in\ntrenches whunkers\n-1 Roland 2 SAM (NU873048)\n-Complex Obstacle (NU870014) Spans corridor, no bypass. AT ditch (10m wide, 4m\ndeep), AT Berm (4m high), 35m ATIAP minefield (TM-57 AT mines, UZM-3 AP mines.\nCovered by MRP, AT Plt and Roland.\n-Numerous wire obstacles throughout his defensive positions (3x strand concertina\nwlsurface laid, trip wire activated 10m deep minefield(UZM-31).\n(2) Capabilities and Limitations: The enemy can defend in place, conduct a delay or\nwithdrawal, reinforce/counterattack with organic unit or counterattack with a MRE3\nlocated at Bagdad within 24 hours.\n  \n \n(3) MPCOA: I expect the en will defend in place and attempt to defeat our attack with\nmassed direct fires at the obstacle and making us fight numerous successive positions.\n(4) MDCOA: En reinforces/counterattacks with the MRB from Bagdad before the corridor\nis secured and hasty defense is established.\nc. Friendly.\n(1) 317\n(a) Mission: 010, 317 clears in zone IOT gain control of the Delta and Cleghom\navenues of approach. 010, defends in sector to deny enemy access to the port of 29\nPalms and prevent interference with coalition forces buildup.\n(b) Commander's Intent: Purpose is to prevent the enemy from advancing through the\nDelta and Cleghorn corridors. Endstate: All enemy forces cleared in zone and one\ncompany per corridor established in defensive positions before the en can CATK.\n(2) Adjacent\n(a) Tm Tank conductes MTC in Cleghorn to clear the corridor.\n(b) India is Bn Reserve.\n(c) 81mm Mortar Section DS to Kilo. CAAT section DS to Kilo.\n(3) Supporting: Btry, 311 1 DS to Bn\n2. Mission: At H-hour, Kilo attacks to clear enemy In zone IOT gain control of the Delta Corridor.\n3. Execution:\na. Concept of Operations and Commander's Intent\n(1) Commander's Intent. It is my intent to attack each enemy position in succession. His\npositions are not mutually supporting allowing us to use supporting arms to attrit and\nisolate his positions. CG. I see his CG as his prepared position ovenvatching the\nobstacle. CV. His ~~xhis non mutually supporting positions. Endstate. Enemy in\nDelta corrG destroyed, Kilo in control of the corridor and in position to defeat any\nenemy attempt to regain the corridor.\n(2) Concept of Operations.\n(a) Scheme of Maneuver. Kilo will attack north in zone with 1 tank platoon up and 2\nmech platoons, 1 OCD back and 1 CAAT in ovenvatch. Upon clearing Delta\ncorridor, Kilo will defend in sector with 1 CAAT and 1 tank platoon up in security\narea, and 2 mech platoons back in BP. Main Effort. One mech plt (+) attacks to\ndestroy the enemy on the southrn half of Co Obj 3. Supporting Effort #l. One mech\nplt (+) attcks to destroy the enemy on the northern half of Co Obj 3. Supporting\nEffort #2. One tank plat provides destruction and suppressive fires IS0 the breach\nand the assault on Co Obj 3. Supporting Effort #3. One OCD conducts a breach of\nthe complex obstacle IS0 the company's attack. Supporting Effort #4. One CAAT\nprovides ovenvatch of the company in its attack north.\n(b) Fire Support Plan. See target lists and schedules.\n(c) Engineer Plan. Conduct breach of enemy obstacle vic 869014 IOT allow for the\ncontinued attack of the company. In the defense, emplace obstacles in the\nchokepoint vic 844086 to disrupt the enemy's advance and to decieve him as to our\nMBA. Emplace an obstacle vic 871033 to fix the enemy in our EA. Prepare\nsurvivability positions in the BP for the company's vehicles.\n  \n \nb.
